Hey Jeff,

This week assignment will be simple, and its divided in two parts.

1. First, i want to exercise what we have seen. I will like you to create
a window program (like the one at the example) to play tik-tak toe. I know
you can design the window, but can you build the logic? I will bring 
an implementation of this on our next class, hope you can code and show me
your work.


2. This one is the challenge. Can you add sound to the example that i gave you? 
I mean, whenever someone click's the "check" button, you could reproduce
the sound of a duck? We will discuss this one on our next class, let me 
know if you cant.


Take a look at the example (see what happens when you press check and 
dont provide a word) and let me know of your questions. Open github issues 
so we can communicate there. Let me know if its too hard (its not easy,
but i want you to have fun).
